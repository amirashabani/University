## AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

* Published in 1998 by two Belgian cryptographers, Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen.
* Originally called Rijndael, it became the winner of AES competition and was selected by NIST as the standard for encryption in 2001.
* For AES, NIST selected three members of the Rijndael family, each with a block size of 128 bits, but three different key lengths: 128, 192, and 256 bits, called AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 respectively.
* The algorithm described by AES is a symmetric-key algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data.
